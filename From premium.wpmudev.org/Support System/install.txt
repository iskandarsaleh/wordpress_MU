Plugin Name: MU Support System
Author: Luke Poland/Andrew Billits (Incsub)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This plugin adds a new "support" menu to the far right of the top
level menu structure.

It allows for users to:
  - View FAQ's (that you create), rate the helpfulness of them.
  - Submit support tickets, which site admins can view and respond
    to in order to improve the end user experience.
    - Note, when a user submits a ticket or reply, an email is sent
      to the site admins email address (the user does not see this).
      When an admin reply's to a ticket, the user gets an email, which
      will come from the email address for the site (Just like any
      other emails a user may receive from the site).


Files:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All files in this package are structured to match the MU installation,
please place the files in their corresponding directory structure. You
will need to create a few directories, so just follow the layout in the
package and you will be fine.


Instructions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Place the files in the specified, corresponding directory. Creating
   the directory if it doesn't exists.
2) If you're not running our Premium Multiple Databases plugin, skip to 
   step 3. 

   Add the following to your db-config.php file, or wherever you are
   declaring your global tables.

add_global_table('system_faq');
add_global_table('system_faq_cats');
add_global_table('system_tickets');
add_global_table('system_tickets_cats');
add_global_table('system_tickets_messages');


3) Visit Site Admin -> FAQ Manager, and Site Admin -> Support Ticket Manager
   so that the required tables auto install. If it does not create 5 new
   tables, see the sql.txt file in this package for MySQL queries you 
   can run.
