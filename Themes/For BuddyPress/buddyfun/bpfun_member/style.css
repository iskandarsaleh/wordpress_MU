/**
 * I find it easier to break down CSS into seperate files, each one tackling a specific component.
 * Of course this is only a guide, you could quite easily keep all your CSS in this style.css file.
 */

/* First, include the "base" styles, that will structure and style the header, main content areas and footer. */
@import url( css/base.css );

/* Next, include the CSS file for each component. Profile, Groups, Friends, etc... */
@import url( css/member-css.css );
@import url( css/global.css );
