To install, just upload the single PHP file (mu_blog_banners.php) to the "mu-plugins" folder under "wp-content".

The full image tag can be output using the "show_blog_banner" function. The function takes two optional parameters:

    * "alt value" - the "alt tag" value for the image (defaults to the blog name).
    * "blog id" - ID of the blog whose banner you want to retrieve (defaults to the current blog)

For instance, if you want to show the current blog's banner, and use the blog tagline for the alt tag, use:

show_blog_banner(get_bloginfo('description'));

If you only want to retrieve the image path for the banner, you can use the "get_blog_banner_src" function, which has 1 parameter (blog ID). Note that this returns the source, and does not display (echo) it.

This has only been fully tested with the latest version of WordPress MU as of its release: 2.8.1. It should work in previous versions that support attachment hooks, including 2.7 builds.
