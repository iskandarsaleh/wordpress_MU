Installation: Just place this file in your wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory.

Usage: A page is created under the Site Admin menu called "Bulk Create Blogs".

To use the plugin you must create correctly formatted data. The plugin takes CSV formatted data where each row contains the following data.

domain, user_id, blog_title, blog_topic
Each of these fields is described below.

    * blog_domain (Mandatory): the domain name of the blog, this should only contain alphanumeric characters and be in all lowercase. If the blog domain is empty then users will be added to the site's root blog.
    * user_name (Mandatory): the login id of the user to be added to the blog.
    * blog_title (Optional): the title of the blog.
    * blog_topic (Optional): the name of the blog topic that this blog will be categorised under. These topics are setup under the 'Blog Topic Management' tab. A blog_title must be chosen if you wish to set the blog topic. (Requires cets_blog_topics plugin.)

When each line is processed, if the blog named already exists then the user given is added to the blog. If the blog does not exist then it is created. If a blog title is not provided then the blog domain is used.

This plugin also provides support for LDAP user creation. If a user does not exist and the ldap_auth plugin is installed then it will attempt to create a new user.

At the moment this plugin only supports sites that use domain blog naming. Support for sub-directories is not planned but you could easily add it yourself.

The number of blogs that can be imported at a time is limited due to php's max_execution_time. You can change the defined limit at the top of the code, but if you do then I suggest increasing your max_execution_time in your php.ini. Having the script get cut off half way through creating a blog may lead to undocumented behaviour. :)
